# Project Title: From Epidemic to Pandemic
### Overview
This project, originally completed as part of a DataCamp course, focuses on visualizing COVID-19 data to understand the progression of the virus from an epidemic to a pandemic. COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus, was first identified in December 2019 in the Wuhan region of China. By March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a pandemic. This analysis aims to explore the spread of the virus across different countries and investigate the impact of country-wide policies, such as shutdowns and quarantines.

### Data Source
The data used in this project is collected from various sources, including the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Ministry of Health from multiple countries. The dataset is provided by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering and is publicly available. It contains information on confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries from the early stages of the outbreak.

### Objectives
- Visualize the spread of COVID-19 globally and identify key milestones in its progression.
- Analyze the effectiveness of country-wide policies in containing the virus.
- Investigate trends and patterns in the data to understand the dynamics of the pandemic.
#### Note
It's essential to note that the information and data regarding COVID-19 are continuously being updated. The data used in this project was pulled on March 17, 2020, and may not reflect the most current situation. Therefore, any conclusions drawn from this analysis should be interpreted with caution and may require updating with the latest data available.
